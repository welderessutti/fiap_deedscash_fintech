<h1>DeedsCash Fintech Project</h1>
<p>This is my full stack version of my FIAP College's Fintech Project.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to create a fintech application, that gives you a financial control of your wallet.</p>
<p>You can record all of your credit and debt transactions, and all of your investiments, helping you achieve your financial goals and reach your dreams.</p>
<p>Here you'll find the main technologies I learned in the first period of my college's programming course.</p>
<h2>Front-end:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML 5</li>
  <li>CSS 3</li>
  <li>Bootstrap 5</li>
</ul>
<h2>Back-end:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>JSP</li>
  <li>JDBC</li>
  <li>Oracle DB</li>
</ul>
<p>The main knowledge here was to understanding how the web application works.</p>
<p>How the user interacts with the app and how the datas passes through the app until the database.</p>
<p>It was developed using the MVC pattern, that includes the Model, View and Controller layers.</p>
<p>I managed to learn how the Servlets Classes (Controller) deal with the user input from the View layer, and how they handle with it to manage its request and response methods to the Model and View layers.</p>
